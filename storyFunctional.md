## **Cloud Engineering Leadership**

Throughout my career, I've been deeply involved in leading the design and implementation of **cloud platforms** that serve as the backbone of large-scale products and services. At Crownpeak, I was responsible for architecting a unified cloud platform built on **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, and **IaC**. The goal was not just to host applications, but to create shared functionalities like **centralized logging**, **monitoring**, **authentication**, and **CI/CD pipelines** that could be leveraged across product lines. 

One of my most significant projects involved leading the **migration from OpsWorks to an immutable infrastructure** based on **AMIs** built with **Packer** and deployed through **Terraform**. This transition drastically improved scalability and reduced deployment times, future-proofing the company's infrastructure.

## **Automation & Testing Frameworks**

Automation has always been at the core of my work. At Attraqt, I took on the challenge of improving our cloud infrastructure’s testing capabilities. I introduced automated testing frameworks for cloud systems using **Terratest** and **Localstack**, which enabled faster and more reliable deployment processes. 

My work extended into product development as well, where I built automated testing frameworks using **RestAssured**, **Cucumber**, **Selenium**, and **RobotFramework**. These systems drastically reduced the time to market and improved product quality by streamlining **functional** and **performance testing**.

## **Cost Optimization & Infrastructure Efficiency**

In every role, I've sought out opportunities to optimize infrastructure to reduce costs while improving efficiency. At Crownpeak, for example, I achieved significant cost savings by migrating from **EBS to EFS** and transitioning services from **EC2** to **Kubernetes**. These optimizations not only reduced costs but also enhanced scalability and reliability, leading to faster deployment and response times.

Additionally, my overhaul of the **centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting systems** using the **ELK stack** and **Prometheus** improved operational efficiency by making systems more customizable and easier to manage.

## **Leadership & Team Development**

I take pride in building high-performing teams. At Attraqt, I managed both **QA** and **Cloud Engineering** teams, balancing a mix of full-time employees and contractors. My leadership focused on **1-on-1 mentoring**, career development coaching, and aligning team goals with broader business objectives. I introduced **SCRUM methodologies** into our Cloud Engineering team, improving collaboration and delivery times across departments.

In my role, I’ve always been driven by the belief that success comes from fostering growth and enabling teams to take ownership of their work.

## **Key Achievements**

- **Internal Development Portal (IDP)**:  
  One of my proudest achievements was introducing the **IDP** at Crownpeak using **GetPort**. This portal centralized essential product information, integrated **SDLC metrics**, and dramatically improved onboarding times for engineers.

- **DNS Migration**:  
  Led the successful migration of **50+ DNS zones** and **thousands of records** from **Dynect to Route53** without causing any downtime, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:  
  Developed and implemented **IaC** for AWS infrastructure, separating systems into modular repositories, which allowed for better management, faster deployments, and more efficient scaling.
