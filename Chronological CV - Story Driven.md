## **Professional Experience**

### **Crownpeak**  
**Cloud Infrastructure Architect**  
*January 2023 – Present | Sofia, Bulgaria*  

When I joined Crownpeak, I was tasked with building a unified, scalable cloud platform that could cater to the needs of multiple product lines. I started by architecting a platform based on **AWS, Kubernetes**, and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. This wasn’t just about getting the infrastructure right—it was about creating a system that allowed the entire company to benefit from shared functionalities like **centralized logging**, **monitoring**, **authentication**, and **CI/CD pipelines**. My integration of **ArgoCD** further improved deployment stability and speed, helping the company achieve seamless continuous delivery.

Beyond that, I spearheaded a complete overhaul of the centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting systems. Using the **ELK stack** and **Prometheus**, I restructured the systems to be more reliable, customizable, and easier for teams to manage. This allowed them to add their own configurations, reducing reliance on manual processes and ensuring smoother operations across the board.

One of my biggest achievements was leading a large-scale migration from **OpsWorks** to **AMI-based infrastructure** using **Packer** and **Terraform**, with parameter management via **Consul**. This resulted in the transition to immutable infrastructure, which drastically improved **scalability** and **reduced deployment times**. 

Additionally, I introduced and implemented an **Internal Development Portal (IDP)** using **GetPort**, which centralized key product information, streamlined **SDLC metrics**, and evaluated the production readiness of our services, dramatically reducing onboarding time for engineers.

**Key Achievements**:
- **Cost Savings**: Optimized infrastructure by migrating from **EBS to EFS** and transitioning services from **EC2** to **Kubernetes**, leading to significant cost reductions.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Created a unified platform that accelerated deployments, testing, and overall delivery times for product teams.
- **Improved System Reliability**: Centralized logging and monitoring improved stability, allowing teams to seamlessly manage configurations.

### **Attraqt**  
**Head of Cloud Value Delivery**  
*July 2019 – April 2023 | Sofia, Bulgaria*  

At Attraqt, I took charge of both the **Cloud Engineering** and **QA teams**. As the **Head of Cloud Value Delivery**, my role was to align cloud infrastructure with the company’s strategic goals, all while ensuring smooth team operations. I managed a combined team of **8 QA engineers** and **6 cloud engineers** (a mix of full-time employees and contractors), focusing heavily on **career development** and **goal setting** through regular **1-on-1 meetings** and **quarterly objectives** that aligned with the company’s key performance indicators.

One of the most impactful initiatives I led was the introduction of **automated testing for cloud infrastructure**. Using tools like **Terratest** and **Localstack**, I developed a robust testing framework that reduced time to market and improved product quality. I also guided the team through a major transition from **Apache+Haproxy** to the **Kong API Gateway**, significantly improving our load balancing capabilities and scalability.

In addition, I spearheaded the **migration of over 50 DNS zones** and **thousands of records** from **Dynect to Route53**, which was executed with zero downtime, ensuring uninterrupted service for our customers. To streamline cloud operations, I also introduced **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, separating our AWS infrastructure into modular repositories that enabled better management and quicker deployments.

**Key Achievements**:
- **Improved Delivery Times**: Reduced response times, improved uptime, and optimized customer satisfaction by streamlining infrastructure and processes.
- **SCRUM Implementation**: Introduced **SCRUM methodologies** within the Cloud Engineering team, improving agility, collaboration, and overall efficiency.
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: Introduced the **Internal Development Portal (IDP)**, which centralized critical product information and improved onboarding efficiency for new engineers.

**Head of Quality Assurance**  
*April 2017 – July 2019 | Sofia, Bulgaria*  

As the **Head of Quality Assurance**, I was responsible for building a high-performing QA team from the ground up. The first challenge I tackled was implementing detailed **release testing procedures** and a centralized **test case repository**, ensuring every release adhered to strict quality standards.

A major part of my success in this role was the development of **automation frameworks** using **RestAssured**, **Cucumber**, **Selenium**, and **RobotFramework**. These frameworks sped up product releases and increased product reliability. To further support the team, I introduced tools for **stress testing** and **performance testing**, both of which contributed to a significant improvement in product quality and reduced time to market.

**Key Achievements**:
- Built the QA team from scratch, establishing a culture of continuous improvement.
- Developed a standardized release testing framework, improving quality and reliability across all product lines.
